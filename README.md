_Abstract_

Scattering relativistic electrons with optical lasers can result in a significant frequency upshift of photons, potentially producing c-rays. This is what linear Compton scattering taught us. Ultra-intense lasers offer nowadays a new paradigm where multiphoton absorption effects come into play. These effects can result in higher harmonics, higher yields, and also electron-positron pairs. This article intends to discriminate the different laser scenarios that have been proposed over the past few years as well as to give scaling laws for future experiments. The energy conversion from lasers or particles to high-frequency photons is addressed for both the well-known counter propagating electron beam-laser interaction and quantum-electrodynamics cascades triggered by various lasers. Constructing bright and energetic gamma-ray sources in con- trolled conditions is within an ace of seeing the light of day.
